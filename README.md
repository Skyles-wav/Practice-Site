Hi guys!

Ok, i'm here only for say that I've been studying about Git and GitHub, and i practiced HTML and CSS too. really i don't have a good knowledge yet, but i intend going practicing and posting some things about how are my development in all this.

i started my studs about Python and JavaScript recently and is really gratifying the feeling of solving questions about programation.

This site, was a challeng proposed for my teacher Gustavo Guanabara (gustavoguanabara here in GitHub), and basically if it consisted in make a web page to speak about the android's history. I admit that i don't ended this project but i intend end a some day.

anyway, have a good day, afternoon or night! :)
